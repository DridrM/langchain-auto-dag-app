# Langchain auto DAG app project

## Overview
Document a project can be tedious, espacialy the larger the project is.
In the same time, understanding the structure of the larger project can be a very useful knowledge ressource to start a new project.
Indeed, you can use an existing structure as a canvas, use specific parts of an existinng structure or improve an existing structure for a new project.
In order to achieve this work automatically, I had the idea to use LLM to track function dependencies between each other within a project scripts.
After tracking all the dependencies, the LLM will then produce a directed acyclic graph of the dependencies  in the form of a script in the Mermaid language.

## Structure of the project
To complete

## Tools used
The main tool used in this project is Langchain for Python. This is a library aimed to interact with LLM APIs or local LLMs and used to build application around
the possibilities given by LLMs.
